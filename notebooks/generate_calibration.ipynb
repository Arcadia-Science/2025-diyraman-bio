    "Version. This is a low cost 532 nm spontaneous Raman system that can be used in two configurations, \n",
    "solid and liquid. This notebook is relevant for both configurations. The motivation is to provide a \n",
    "way to characterize the behavior and capabilities of the system, provide information for \n",
    "troubleshooting or possible improvements, and compare the results of this system to others, both in \n",
    "house and in literature/databases. The notebook repeats a series of steps with different samples: \n",
    "import data, plot, find peaks, fit peaks with gaussians, compare with published reference data, \n",
    "create linear equation for adjustment, and measure positional error. In general, we suggest using \n",
    "unbaselined spectra for neon and acetonitrile to generate these equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The aims of this notebook are: \n",
    "* To provide a conversion from the pixel to wavelength (nm) to wavenumber (cm-1) space\n",
    "    * Wavenumber (cm-1) is typically used for Raman spectroscopy and is a relative value based on \n",
    "    the excitation wavelength. The excitation line is usually provided in nanometers (e.g. 532 nm)\n",
    "* To calibrate the system to an organic standard material to improve the expected error of the \n",
    "system (i.e. the +/- cm-1) and reflect acquisition conditions\n",
    "* To generate experimental values for key metrics: the positional error, the full width half maximum\n",
    " (peak width), and signal to noise ratio (SNR) for peaks in the reference material\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Notes:\n",
    "* This notebook will output a lot of figures in some steps, which are useful if you want to check\n",
    "peak fits and adjust. If you don't want so many outputs, you can comment out the plotting lines. \n",
    "* Several steps in this notebook will save figures or CSV files in the /data/processed folder. It's\n",
    "easy to overwrite existing files if you're running the notebook or steps multiple times. You can \n",
    "also create a different output folder to use instead of /data/processed/..."
