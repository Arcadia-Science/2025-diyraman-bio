L-methionine,Solid,545,10.1016/j.vibspec.2012.12.004,"Many peaks in the spectrum collected from L-methionine matched L-methionine literature [doi: 10.1016/j.vibspec.2012.12.004], however, not all of them do.

This might be due to a combination of factors: our sample was powder instead of the more commonly used crystal, our spectral resolution was lower than the compared system, and we likely used a less powerful laser. Several of the peaks we did expect to see appeared as shoulders, likely due to the limited spectral resolution of our system. Surprisingly, we saw minor peaks that weren't in the reference spectrum at 1,072 cm−1, 1,177 cm−1, 1,494 cm−1, and 1,620 cm−1. While unconfirmed, these may be due to trace contamination.
